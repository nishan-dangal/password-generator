-Plan the File Structure
Organize your project into three files:

main.py: The entry point of the application. It will coordinate the program by calling functions from other files.
generator.py: Contains the logic for generating passwords.
user_input.py: Handles user interaction and gathers preferences.




- Why Use This Structure?

1. Separation of Concerns:
generator.py handles the logic for generating passwords.
user_input.py handles interaction with the user.
main.py coordinates the flow of the application.

2. Reusability:
You can reuse generator.py in other projects or add new input methods (e.g., a GUI).

3. Scalability:
The modular design makes it easy to add features like saving passwords or using APIs for additional functionality.
